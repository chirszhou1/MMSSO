MMSS is defined as the state sets of the time-sequence maintenance motion, is proposed to serve as a motion object to connect to other maintenance ontologies.

MMSS describes the temporal and spatial of motions and the core elements associated with each state. The objectives of constructing the MMSSO framework are twofold: (i) integrate and express knowledge from different perspectives and (ii) output information containing maintenance motion state sequences.

MMSSO.owl is committed on Oct 28, 2023 as the first version
